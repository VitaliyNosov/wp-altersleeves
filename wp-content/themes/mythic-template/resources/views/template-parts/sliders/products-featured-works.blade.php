                                Inspired by a Najeela, the Blade Blossom deck, we wanted to make a design that makes the
                                cards 'next level!' Something that would enhance the existing art; that fits with
                                virtually any theme, color, or set. It looks just as good on a new card as it does on
                                your old border treasures.
